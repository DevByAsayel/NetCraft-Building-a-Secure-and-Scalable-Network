# NetCraft: Building a Secure and Scalable Network

This project focuses on designing and implementing a secure, scalable, and well-structured enterprise network.  
The network is divided into four departments, each with its own subnet, switch, and access control, while being linked through a central routing system and core network services.

  - Administration (4 PCs)
  - Accounting (4 PCs)
  - IT Department (5 PCs)
  - HR Department (3 PCs)
- Four switches (one per department)
- One main router for inter-network communication
- Two servers providing:
  - DHCP Services
  - DNS Services
  - Centralized File Hosting
 Objectives
- Build a secure network topology following enterprise standards
- Apply subnetting and VLAN segmentation for scalability
- Configure inter-VLAN routing and ensure full connectivity
- Deploy essential services (DHCP, DNS, File Server)
- Document IP planning and device configuration professionally
